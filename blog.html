                <h1 class="text-xl text-black text-center">var</h1>
                <p>Function Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the function in which they are defined.
                    Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted, which means they are moved to the top of their function or global scope during compilation.</p>
                <h1 class="text-xl text-black text-center">let</h1>
                <p>Block Scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped. They are accessible only within the block (a pair of curly braces) where they are defined.
                    No Hoisting: Unlike var, variables declared with let are not hoisted, so you cannot access them before they are declared.</p>
                <h1 class="text-xl text-black text-center">const</h1>
                <p>Block Scope: Like let, variables declared with const are also block-scoped.
                    Immutable: Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after they are initialized. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, their properties or elements can be modified.</p>
